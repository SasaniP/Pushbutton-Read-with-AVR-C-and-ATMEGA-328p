# Pushbutton-Read-with-AVR-C-and-ATMEGA-328p
Here the input from the pushbutton is read and accordingly the LED will be switched on or off. 
This is done with basics of AVR C programming.
The AVR C program will be uploaded to the Arduino UNO ATMEGA-328p using ARDUINO IDE. 

The input from the push button is taken in from the DIGITAL PIN 8.
The output to the LED was given from the DIGITAL PIN 3.
